DESIGN 

The application has been designed in an aesthetic and minimalistic way. The design is simple yet elegant in the colors orange and black. Search results are just headings and icons, no unnecessary details and are added and removed as the number of search results increase or decrease.


Welcome Text

The welcome text disappears on searching and is replaced by search results and a pagination option at the bottom. It also tells the user how to search using the filters on the right.


Navbar

The application has a navbar on top, which automatically takes users to the home page and refreshes all search contents.


Search Box

The search box has options to search by artist name, album name, track name, year or genre. The year specified can be a date or a range of dates (e.g. 2000 or 2000-2014). Also, as the user may want to search by more than one option, he or she can type in multiple text inputs and search with multiple filters.

The search box, while typing, changes the color of the text to white. This is because the user should know the app is recording the change.

On pressing the search button, the input text boxes clear, leaving a clean display for the next search.


Pagination

The user can go back and forth using the previous and next buttons. In order to prevent errors, the previous button has been disabled for the first input and the next button has been disabled for the last input.


Search Results

The are in the form of icons rather than a list not only because it is more attractive, but because it would be less confusing - following the minimalistic approach. Each result comes with basic information and a Spotify widget to play and pause songs as per the user.


Footer

Added for aesthetic value.
